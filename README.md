***Hey GPT for ZSH*** 

Inspired by [Kade Killary's hey_gpt]https://kadekillary.work/posts/1000x-eng/, which was written for fish.
Now we have hey_gpt for zsh.

Make sure you have jq installed.

Make sure you add your open api key as an environment variable $OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"

Set your model to gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 or whatever you want/have access to

Add the function to your .zprofile or .zshrc.
